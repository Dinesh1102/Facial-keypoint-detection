## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Join the Kaggle Competition

- Go to the [Kaggle Facial Keypoint Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facial-keypoints-detection) and **Join** the competition.

### 2. Download `kaggle.json`

- Navigate to your Kaggle [Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
- Scroll down to the **API** section and click **Create New API Token**.
- This will download a file named `kaggle.json`.

## üß™ Training (Using Google Colab)
If you want to train the model follow these steps, else skip to inference section to use pre-trained model directly.
1. Open the `train.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**. [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AN7BTnyOPTPCgmy1jEbS-DelEcAU8ZFR?usp=sharing)
2. Upload your `kaggle.json` file in the notebook session.
3. Run all cells to train the model.
